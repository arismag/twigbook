# Twig + Storybook = Twigbook

- `npm install`
- Write your stories under the `twig` folder.
- See existing samples to get ideas.

This is currently a proof of work for twig+storybook. It has no bells nor whistles,
like SASS compilers or other fancy stuff.
It is also highly possible that there are misconfigured areas, in that case please
go ahead and create a pull request.

**You are encouraged to clone this repo and adapt it to your needs!**
**You are even more encouraged to share your improvements if you like.**
